Course repository of the JvS statistics seminar
================

## Description

The Statistics Seminar of the Julius-von-Sachs-Institute is an open,
informal meeting for anyone interested in improving their statistical
literacy and their R skill set. It is mainly directed at the PhD
students working at the institute, but anyone else (BSc and MSc
students, Postdocs & PIs, people from other institutes etc.) are
welcome. Currently, we are dealing with rather basal topics which are
not related to biological questions, so if you’re from a different field
you may benefit nonetheless.

The Seminar takes place monthly, normally on the last Wednesday at 17:00
(changes will be announced here).

This repository is meant for the storage and exchange of course
materials, presentations, useful resources for self-learning etc. and
will be expanded continuously (feel free to contribute).

## Course Wiki

A [Wiki page](https://github.com/r-link/Julius_von_Stats/wiki) for the
course is under construction. Besides a collection of links to [useful
resources](https://github.com/r-link/Julius_von_Stats/wiki/Useful-resources),
it is planned to use this platform to address a couple of frequently
asked questions.
